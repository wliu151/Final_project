## Reading Data

```{r}
#Taking into account players drafted after 2009, remove empty 3pt. Cells
NBA_Players_Draft <- read.csv("../Final_project3/renv/nbaplayersdraft.csv")
players_before_curry <- subset(NBA_Players_Draft, year < 2009)
players_before_curry <- players_before_curry[!is.na(players_before_curry$X3_point_percentage), ]

players_after_curry <- subset(NBA_Players_Draft, year >= 2009)
players_after_curry <- players_after_curry[!is.na(players_after_curry$X3_point_percentage), ]
```

## Means Before and After Curry

```{r}

```
## Outliers Before Curry
```{r}

IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1  # Interquartile Range

# Define outlier bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value

## Veterans (1000 games or more) With Largest 3pt Percentage before Curry
```{r}

## Veterans (1000 games or more) With Smallest 3pt Percentage

## Barplot Comparing Means Between Two Groups
