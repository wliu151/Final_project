Question : Are three point percentages for NBA players higher after Stephen Curry was drafted versus before Stephen Curry was drafted?

```{r}
NBA <- read.csv("nbaplayersdraft.csv", check.names = FALSE)

summary(NBA)
```

```{r}
# Filter players drafted before 2009
players_before_curry <- subset(NBA, year < 2009)

# Calculate the mean of the 3-point percentage
mean_three_pt_before_curry <- mean(players_before_curry$`3_point_percentage`, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print the result
print(mean_three_pt_before_curry)


```

```{r}
# Filter players drafted before 2009
players_before_curry <- subset(NBA, year < 2009)

# Calculate IQR for 3-point percentage
Q1 <- quantile(players_before_curry$`3_point_percentage`, 0.4, na.rm = TRUE)  # First quartile
Q3 <- quantile(players_before_curry$`3_point_percentage`, 0.6, na.rm = TRUE)  # Third quartile
IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1  # Interquartile Range

# Define outlier bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value
print(lower_bound)
print(upper_bound)
# Find players with 3-point percentage below lower bound or above upper bound
outliers_before_curry <- subset(players_before_curry, 
                                `3_point_percentage` < lower_bound | `3_point_percentage` > upper_bound)

# Print the outliers
print(outliers_before_curry)


```

```{r}
# Subset the data to filter players who played more than 1000 games before 2009
players_filtered <- subset(NBA, year < 2009 & games > 1000)
print(players_filtered)
# Find the index of the player with the maximum 3-point percentage
max_three_index <- which.max(players_filtered$`3_point_percentage`)

# Get the player's name
skilled_three_player_name <- players_filtered[max_three_index, "player"]

# Print the player's name
print(skilled_three_player_name)

```

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
players_filtered <- subset(NBA, year < 2009 & games > 1000)
ggplot(players_filtered, aes(x = `3_point_percentage`, y = `points_per_game`)) +
  geom_point() +  # scatter plot for 3-point percentage vs points per game
  labs(x = "3-Point Percentage", y = "Points per Game") +
  ggtitle("3-Point Percentage vs Points per Game\n(Players Drafted Before 2009 and Games > 1000)") +
  theme_minimal()

```
